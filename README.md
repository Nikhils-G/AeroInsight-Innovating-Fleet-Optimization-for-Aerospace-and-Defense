Real-Time Data Analytics for Optimal Performance and Safety

## TITLE : " FleetOptix: Revolutionizing Aerospace and Defense Fleet Management "
## SUBTILE : "Real-Time Data Analytics for Optimal Performance and Safety"
## Problem Statement :

### Aerospace and defense fleets face significant challenges that can lead to costly inefficiencies:

- Unexpected Maintenance Issues: These lead to unplanned downtime, costing airlines up to $150,000 per hour. For a single aircraft, this can amount to $1-2 million annually.
- Inefficient Fuel Consumption: Inefficient fleet management can increase fuel costs by 3-5%, adding up to $1 billion annually for large airlines.
- Supply Chain Disruptions: Delays in the supply chain can result in tens of millions in losses for large defense projects due to production delays.
- Safety Concerns: A lack of real-time performance data increases safety risks, which can lead to catastrophic failures.
- Real Time Consideration : The aerospace and defense industry faces tremendous financial and operational pressures. For example, Boeing has estimated that inefficiencies in fleet management can lead to losses of $10-20 million per day for large defense projects.
